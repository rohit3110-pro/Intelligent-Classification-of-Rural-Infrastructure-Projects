# Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillBuild Virtual Internship Program**. It focuses on building a machine learning model to classify rural infrastructure projects under the correct **PMGSY scheme** (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.) based on their physical and financial attributes.

## üìå Objective

To automate the classification of rural road and bridge projects into their respective PMGSY schemes using machine learning, improving accuracy, scalability, and efficiency over manual methods.

---

## üß† What the Model Does

- Takes in project data (e.g., cost, length, funding details)
- Processes and cleans the data
- Trains a classification model on labeled examples
- Predicts the correct PMGSY scheme for new project entries

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **IBM Watson Studio**
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage**
- **IBM Cloud Lite account**
